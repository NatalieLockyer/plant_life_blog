# [Purpose of the Project]
Plant Life is a ficticious website dedicated to sharing plant based recipes and health benefits with with its followers. The website has been designed to to inform users of how beneficial it is to switch to a plant-based diet. Not only is it great for your health, the recipes are delicious too. 
This is a full stack frame work built using the Django framework. The wesbsite provides its followers with an 'about us' page, a benefits page, a recipes page which can be filtered into categories so the user doesnt have to wade through all the recipes if they just wanted a breakfast recipe. Users can also comment on the recipes, edit and delete their comment. Users are required to register in order to comment.
