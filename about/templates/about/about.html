                            Hi, I'm Tilly and I created and designed "Plant Life". I first looked at a plant-based
                            diet when I
                            experienced some minor health issues and realized my diet was possibly contributing to it.
                            The more I delved
                            into the plant world, the more I discovered the many health benefits of cooking with them.
                            I'm excited to share
                            with you what I have learned and look forward to any feedback about the ideas and recipes
                            throughout the site.
